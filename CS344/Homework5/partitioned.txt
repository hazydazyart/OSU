I split up the work of marking primes by dividing the number of slots by the 
number of threads/processes. The code looks like this for the multi=process version:

        for(int i = 0; i < num_procs; i++) {
                if(t_remainder > 0) {
			t_remainder--;
                        procs.start = offset;
                        offset += (split + 1) * CHAR_BIT;
                        procs.end = offset + 1;
                } else {
                        procs.start = offset;
                        offset += split * CHAR_BIT;
                        procs.end = offset - 1;
                }
                procs.index = i;

	After this, it either forks the processes or joins the threads. It
sets the offset for the remainders first. The offset is moved by the number of
bits handled per process.

	The index field was just used for my own testing, to ensure the threads/processes 
had equal amounts of work and to check what they were working on.
