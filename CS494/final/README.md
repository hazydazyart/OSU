# Final Project

Our guidelines for this webpage was to create anything that utilized everything we learned during the quarter.

I created a website that allows users to register and save multiple teams of Pokemon. Users can add a profile photo and have a friends list. Mutual friends may see each other's lists of Pokemon.
