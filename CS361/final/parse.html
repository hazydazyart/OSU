	<h3>What is JRF?</h3>
	<p>A JRF file is a resume that has been parsed into a human readable markup language. Using JRF, a resume can be quickly reviewed by a person or easily parsed by a computer. JRF files can simplify the application process by allowing users to one-click upload their skills and experience, and allow employers to easily find applicants that fit their needs.</p>
